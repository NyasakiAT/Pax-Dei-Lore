- Everything that has to do with this world is impure
- Nothing is worth enjoying 
- Nothing is worth saving

- in the Kingdom of Heaven all souls are the same, no males, no females, indeed no bodies or visual form at all

- Carnal love is the ultimate trap laid to corrupt the spirit and keep it perpetually in his grip.
- Removing any signs of the sexual division is an effort to get closer to God.
